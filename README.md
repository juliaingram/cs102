# CS 102: Data Tools & Techniques

This repository contains a project I did in Spring 2020 for the Stanford undergraduate course CS 102: Data Tools and Techniques. I analyzed COVID-19 data from The New York Times and Google's Mobility Reports to find and visualize trends in relative compliance with stay-at-home orders and COVID cases.
